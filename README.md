Why install FB's 1000000MB data-sucking apps on your phone when you have the power of 1999 in your hands?

Are you also an old geezer who misses the glory days of hunter2 and getting slapped with a trout?

Then this is the app for you!

## Well, wtf is it actually?

Sepia is an IRC server that is integrated with FB messenger. This decentralizes the FB.
You can now use any IRC client with Messenger.

This is implemented from scratch in Akka actors, with networking done with raw TCP. 

## Dependencies

- JDK
- JRE
- sbt

and sbt will pull all the rest of the dependent packages.
